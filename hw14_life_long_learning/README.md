data.ipynb:                       
get SVHN,MNIST and USPS dataset,split dataset to get train_loader and val_loader         

model.ipynb:          
model structure for classification and algorithms of EWC,MAS,SCP            

train.ipynb:              
training processes of using none life long learning algorithm,using EWC,using MAS,using SCP              

main.ipynb:           
Part1——train on three tasks using EWC,MAS,Basic and plot result

utils.ipynb:           
some useful functions and class              

***_acc.txt:    
accuracy data  saved in the process of training by *** algorithm

model.ckpt:     
models saved in the process of training

model.opt:     
optimizers saved in the process of training       

run main.ipynb to get result,notic that you should run Part1 cell and Part2 cell separately.
